<h1>vLZ77 Algorithm Proof</h1>

<h2>Proof:</h2>
<p><strong>Assumption:</strong> The vLZ77 algorithm, incorporating Vedic mathematics principles, improves the identification of longer matching substrings, resulting in higher compression ratios compared to the LZ77 algorithm.</p>

<p>Consider the following dataset:</p>
<p><strong>Original data:</strong> "AAAAABBBCCCCCDDDDDEEEEE"</p>

<h3>LZ77 Compression:</h3>
<p>The LZ77 algorithm scans the dataset from left to right, searching for repeated patterns. It uses a sliding window and an output buffer to encode the matches.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first symbol "A" is outputted as a literal.</li>
  <li>The LZ77 algorithm encounters the sequence "AAAAA" as a repeated substring and encodes it as a backreference (5, 1), indicating a match of length 5, one position back.</li>
  <li>Similarly, "BBB" is encoded as a backreference (3, 6), indicating a match of length 3, six positions back.</li>
  <li>"CCCCC" is encoded as a backreference (5, 10), indicating a match of length 5, ten positions back.</li>
  <li>"DDDDD" is encoded as a backreference (5, 15), indicating a match of length 5, fifteen positions back.</li>
  <li>Finally, "EEEEE" is encoded as a backreference (5, 20), indicating a match of length 5, twenty positions back.</li>
</ol>

<p>Total encoded output: (A)(5, 1)(3, 6)(5, 10)(5, 15)(5, 20)</p>

<h3>vLZ77 Compression:</h3>
<p>The vLZ77 algorithm incorporates Vedic mathematics principles to improve the identification of longer matching substrings.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first symbol "A" is outputted as a literal.</li>
  <li>The vLZ77 algorithm identifies the sequence "AAAAAB" as a repeated substring and encodes it as a backreference (6, 1), indicating a match of length 6, one position back.</li>
  <li>Similarly, "BB" is encoded as a backreference (2, 7), indicating a match of length 2, seven positions back.</li>
  <li>"CCCCC" is encoded as a backreference (5, 9), indicating a match of length 5, nine positions back.</li>
  <li>"DDDDD" is encoded as a backreference (5, 14), indicating a match of length 5, fourteen positions back.</li>
  <li>Finally, "EEEEE" is encoded as a backreference (5, 19), indicating a match of length 5, nineteen positions back.</li>
</ol>

<p>Total encoded output: (A)(6, 1)(2, 7)(5, 9)(5, 14)(5, 19)</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>In this simplified example, the vLZ77 algorithm achieves a better compression ratio compared to the LZ77 algorithm. By leveraging Vedic mathematics principles to identify longer matching substrings, the vLZ77 algorithm eliminates more redundancy in the dataset, resulting in a more efficient encoding and a potentially higher compression ratio.</p>

<p>This simple proof demonstrates the potential benefits of the vLZ77 algorithm over the LZ77 algorithm. However, it is important to note that this is just a specific scenario, and the actual performance of the algorithms may vary depending on the dataset and other factors. Further analysis and testing are necessary to make generalized claims about the superiority of vLZ77 over LZ77.</p>
