# vLZ77 vs LZ77 Compression Proof

This repository contains an implementation of the vLZ77 and LZ77 compression algorithms and a graphical proof comparison between the two algorithms.

## Overview

The vLZ77 and LZ77 algorithms are lossless data compression algorithms that use sliding window techniques to achieve compression. This proof comparison demonstrates the compression ratios achieved by both algorithms on a given input data.

## Author

This proof comparison application is authored by Sundeepan Sen.

## Usage

To run the proof comparison, execute the `proof_comparison_gui.py` file. A GUI window will appear with a "Run Proof" button. Clicking the button will execute the vLZ77 and LZ77 compression algorithms, calculate the compression ratios, and display the results graphically.

## Requirements

This proof comparison application requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- tkinter
- matplotlib

To install the required libraries, use pip:

```bash
pip install tkinter matplotlib
